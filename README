The idea behind my memex implementation is this - browsing the web and jumping from one uri to another is itself very much like creating a trail of information. I have created a plugin that like a camera allows the user to click record and then every activity in the browser gets saved as a memex trail.

A normal use case is as follows.
User clicks the plugin icon and is shown the Authorize button
User clicks Authorize and is taken to an options page where he provides a delicious username and password
User clicks Update and his 50 most recent bookmarks are shown on the page
User now clicks the plugin icon again and is shown the Record button
User clicks Record and starts browsing
User may click Pause at any time to stop making trails and check email for instance
Use can click Stop at any time to terminate the trail
The trails are named using the title of the first web page in the trail
Users password is stored using rc4 symmetric enrcyption/decryption
